- [ ] make video editing easier for high production value segments
- [ ] make high polished renders of our projects with minimal effort
- [ ] reduce time spent in blender GUI
- [ ] automate batch renders of scenes and frames
- [ ] create tools to expand our blender capabilities via custom python scripts (ie. mathematical based layouts in python)

### Use example: Orbit
`<blender 4.5 path>\blender.exe -b .\template-orbit-gs.blend -P .\stl_green_orbit.py -- <path to stl file>`
